# 🧩 JSONPlaceholder Users & Posts

A simple JavaScript project that fetches and displays **users** and their **posts** dynamically using the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).  
Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** with `XMLHttpRequest`.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetch all users from the API and display them in a styled list.  
- Click any user to view their related posts instantly.  
- Dynamic rendering using pure JavaScript (no frameworks).  
- Clean and responsive layout.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**  
- **XMLHttpRequest API**

---


---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The app sends a request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users` to fetch all users.  
2. When a user is clicked, it sends another request to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId={id}`.  
3. The user’s posts are displayed dynamically in the posts section.

## 🧠 Learning Goals
This project was created to practice:
- Working with **APIs** in JavaScript  
- Using **XMLHttpRequest**  
- Manipulating the **DOM** dynamically  
- Handling **user interactions** and rendering content
